| Course Description     | 
This advanced undergraduate course explores the use and application of emerging technology and methods in scholarly activity in the humanities. Using the Python programming language, the main part of the course is organized around method-driven weekly topics, including data collection, data visualization, spatial analysis, text encoding, network analysis, machine learning, and text analysis, among others. Additionally, the course covers conceptual themes such as debates and critiques surrounding digital humanities and examines how computational methods contribute to established humanities disciplines such as literature and history, as well as adjacent disciplines in the social sciences.<br>
The course adopts a comprehensive approach, blending lectures, seminars, and labs. Through engaging readings, dynamic class discussions, programming assignments, and a semester project, students gain a comprehensive overview of the research field of computing in the humanities. They also acquire hands-on experience in utilizing Python for data analysis, especially in the context of humanities topics. Moreover, students are exposed to the entire lifecycle of conducting research on a self-defined topic in computing in the humanities.|
