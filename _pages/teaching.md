1. <i>IS_LT 7301: Library and Information Technology</i>. University of Missouri, Fall 2024.<br>Average Course Evaluation Score: 4.61/5.00.<br>Course Description: This graduate course introduces the emerging field of digital humanities, with a particular focus on its relationship to information. The course is organized around weekly topics that explore the use and application of emerging technologies and methods in humanities scholarship. Topics include methods such as data visualization, spatial analysis, text encoding, network analysis, and machine learning, among others, as well as conceptual themes like debates and critiques within digital humanities, recent developments in AI, and the contributions of digital humanities to various fields. These fields include established humanities disciplines like literature and history, adjacent disciplines in the social sciences, and libraries.<br>The course adopts a comprehensive approach, combining synchronous and asynchronous sessions. Through engaging readings, discussions, lab assignments, and a semester project, students will gain a broad understanding of the field of digital humanities. They will also acquire hands-on experience with basic digital technologies and computational methods for data analysis, and develop skills in critically analyzing and reviewing research projects or in proposing and conducting their own. This course aims to prepare students to navigate the opportunities and challenges they will encounter in future roles in librarianship and other information professions, particularly in areas that engage or support activities related to digital humanities.
2. <i>IS 310: Computing in the Humanities</i>. University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Fall 2023.<br>Average Course Evaluation Score: 4.62/5.00.<br>Course Description: This advanced undergraduate course explores the use and application of emerging technology and methods in scholarly activities in the humanities. Using the Python programming language, the main part of the course is organized around method-driven weekly topics, including data collection, data visualization, spatial analysis, text encoding, network analysis, machine learning, and text analysis, among others. Additionally, the course covers conceptual themes such as debates and critiques surrounding digital humanities and examines how computational methods contribute to established humanities disciplines such as literature and history, as well as adjacent disciplines in the social sciences. The course adopts a comprehensive approach, blending lectures, seminars, and labs. Through engaging readings, dynamic class discussions, programming assignments, and a semester project, students gain a comprehensive overview of the research field of computing in the humanities. They also acquire hands-on experience in utilizing Python for data analysis, especially in the context of humanities topics. Moreover, students are exposed to the entire lifecycle of conducting research on a self-defined topic in computing in the humanities.
